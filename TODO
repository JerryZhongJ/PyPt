- storeless heap model!
- giveup context chain! no context sensitive
- optimize ir: 
    - for GetAttr and same source.attr, let the target be the same
- self-construct entry-point, cancel addReachable(allAll)
- GetItem, SetItem, builtin-functions
- re-design fake object
- optimize class method object, static method object
    - class method object should be simply a wrapper over a function, transformed every time when it is resolved
- fix generator expression's scope
- default arguments, a better way
- with-clause
- exception
